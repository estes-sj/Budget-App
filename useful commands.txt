The complete path of python.exe can be added by:

Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.

Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.

Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.

In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.

Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.

Python can now be used directly from the command prompt without having to write its location. Try executing the command python --version; it will output the version of Python installed on your system.

Usually you can find the python installed binary in this path location: C:\Users\Educative\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39
